this is intersting 
.1.3.6.1.4.1.2021.9.1.2.2 = STRING: "/var/www/html/seeddms51x/seeddms"



login was michelle michelle
https://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/50062


<database dbDriver="mysql" dbHostname="localhost" dbDatabase="seeddms" dbUser="seeddms" dbPass="ied^ieY6xoquu" doNotCheckVersion="false">


got logged into cockpit

thought michelle as username again was too obvious, but it ended up being michelle and a reused password from the database above

go to terminal, user flag was right there 34d7c938a1990098d0f2034464de819a


escalation was rough, had to research

snmp has a file called monitoring, it runs scripts

cat: /usr/bin/monitoring/: No such file or directory
[michelle@pit ~]$ cat /usr/bin/monitor 
#!/bin/bash

for script in /usr/local/monitoring/check*sh
do
    /bin/bash $script
done

curled custom script to inject pubkey


could not get it to run, found help
snmpwalk -m +MY-MIB -v2c -c public 10.10.10.241 nsExtendObjects
sudo download-mibs


finally that worked, curled file as check.sh, ran snmp, got ssh key added
